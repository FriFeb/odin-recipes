    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>
        Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar,
        honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate syrup
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Have a baking sheet or heatproof platter
        ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt;
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg.</li>
      <li>
        Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened. (Do not
        overmix; a few small lumps are fine).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium.
        Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub
        skillet with oiled paper towel
      </li>
      <li>
        For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using
        the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able
        to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1
        to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the
        underside, 1 to 2 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil,
        and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter.
        (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
      </li>
